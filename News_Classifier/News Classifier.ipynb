    "# README for News Article Collection and Categorization Application\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This application is designed to collect news articles from various RSS feeds, store them in a database, categorize them based on predefined categories, and enhance the categorization for articles that do not fit neatly into existing categories. The primary technologies used include Python, SQLAlchemy for database management, and spaCy for natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Creation and Data Extraction**:\n",
    "   - **Logic**: This part of the code establishes the database schema and creates tables necessary for storing the articles. It also includes the logic for extracting articles from specified RSS feeds.\n",
    "   - **Design Choice**: Using SQLAlchemy allows for easy management of database interactions and supports multiple database backends. The code is modular to ensure easy modifications in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Categorization of Data Using spaCy**:\n",
    "   - **Logic**: The collected articles are categorized using predefined keywords associated with specific categories. The code checks the titles, summaries, and provided categories of the articles for matches against these keywords.\n",
    "   - **Design Choice**: spaCy is utilized for its efficient natural language processing capabilities, allowing for robust keyword matching. The use of a dictionary for category keywords makes it easy to update or expand categories as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Categorization for \"Others\"**:\n",
    "   - **Logic**: Articles that do not match any of the predefined categories are categorized into a general \"Others\" category. This section of the code further refines this category by breaking it down into subcategories such as Economy, Technology, Health, Environment, and Social Issues based on additional keywords.\n",
    "   - **Design Choice**: This enhancement improves the granularity of article categorization and helps in better reporting and analysis of articles that would otherwise be lost in a broad \"Others\" category.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Printing Categorized Articles**:\n",
    "   - **Logic**: The final section of the code prints out the details of each categorized article, including the title, content, link, published date, media URL, and assigned category. It also summarizes the total count of articles in each category.\n",
    "   - **Design Choice**: This allows for easy verification of the categorization process and ensures that users can see the results in a structured and readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy\n",
    "- spaCy\n",
    "- A database management system (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)\n",
    "- An RSS feed source\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a user interface for easier interaction with the application.\n",
    "- Add functionalities for users to input custom keywords for categorization.\n",
    "- Integrate machine learning techniques for more dynamic categorization based on article content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This application provides a foundational system for collecting and categorizing news articles, leveraging modern tools and techniques in database management and natural language processing. The modular design allows for future enhancements and adaptations to meet evolving needs.\n"
